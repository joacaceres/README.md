# README.md
I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional transitioning after nine years in a high-pressure full-time career as a chef, where I developed strong discipline, attention to detail, and reliability. I approach work with a clear sense of responsibility and integrity, believing that security work must be done correctly, not halfway.

I am particularly interested in information security, social media safety, and cyber threat prevention. I have completed formal cybersecurity training and gained hands-on experience with tools including Kali Linux, Nmap, Wireshark, VirtualBox, and security simulation environments. While I am early in my cybersecurity career, I bring a strong learning mindset, respect for procedures, and the ability to operate calmly under pressure.

I am seeking an entry-level security or SOC role where I can contribute to monitoring, investigation, and incident response while continuing to develop my technical skills and add long-term value to a security team.
